## Inspirations

AI Tells builds on ideas from many projects and tools. Acknowledgments appear here as integrations land.

## AI help

The development of this tool involved [Claude](https://claude.ai), an AI language model. AI tools contributed to drafting code, tests, and documentation. Human authors made all design decisions and final implementations, and they reviewed, edited, and validated AI-generated content. The authors take full responsibility for the correctness of this software.
