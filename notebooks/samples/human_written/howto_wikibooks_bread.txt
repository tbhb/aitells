There are many types of bread across the world, each with its own history, style, and taste. Typically, these can be described according to a couple characteristics.

Leavened breads include a component to lighten and expand the crumb, while unleavened breads do not. As a result, unleavened bread is usually denser. Beyond the simple presence/absence of leavener, breads can also be classified as yeasted breads, which use yeast as the leavener, or quickbreads, which use a chemical leavener like baking powder or baking soda—either way, the resulting carbon dioxide gas is what leavens the bread.

Loaves are shaped to have several inches of height, with an outer crust and inner crumb that have different textures—they are almost always leavened and made with a significant proportion of wheat flour. On the other hand, flatbreads are thin and usually crustless, though they may be either leavened or unleavened. Because of their simplicity and non-reliance on leavening, flatbreads are the most basic and widespread type of bread worldwide, and they can use a range of flours. Typically, flatbreads local to a culture will incorporate the grains or starches local to that area.

Lean breads have little to no fat in them, while enriched breads contain fat, eggs, and or sugar, all of which impact the texture. Typically, enriched breads have a much softer and more tender crumb as a result. Like cheese, bread is made from very simple ingredients, and it is the specific choices made during the multi-stage production process that create the wide array of options we see.
