# Human-written samples

This directory holds human-written text samples for comparison with AI-generated samples.

## Sourcing guidelines

Samples should come from public domain sources:

- **Standard Ebooks** (standardebooks.org): Curated public domain texts with clean formatting. Look for essays and shorter non-fiction.
- **Project Gutenberg**: Pre-1928 texts in the public domain.
- **Government publications**: Public domain by default. Technical reports, guides, and explanations work well.
- **Wikimedia**: Transcribed public domain documents.

## Selection criteria

Choose texts that roughly match the AI samples in:

- **Length**: 2-3 paragraphs
- **Genre**: Explanatory/educational, essay/opinion, technical description
- **Topic area**: Science, reading/literature, technology (when possible)

## File format

Save samples as plain `.txt` files. Use descriptive names that show the source and topic:

- `gutenberg_essay_education.txt`
- `govt_photosynthesis.txt`
- `standardebooks_reading.txt`
