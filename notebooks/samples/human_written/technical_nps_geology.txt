The inspiring landscapes of the United States captivate with their beauty and power—and sometimes danger! But the same geological forces that threaten our lives with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions also nourish our spirits by forming our country’s spectacular mountains, valleys, and coastlines. National parks, monuments and seashores highlight this scenery and reveal Earth’s processes in action.

An area is established as a national park, monument, seashore, or other unit of the National Park Service because it displays something special about the cultural or natural history of the United States. The role of the National Park Service is to protect those features and make them accessible to the public. Geological features are an important part of this heritage, not only because they help us understand Earth’s history, but also because they are the landscapes upon which our country’s cultural and natural history take place.

We live on a layer of Earth known as the lithosphere which is a collection of rigid slabs that are shifting and sliding into each other. These slabs are called tectonic plates and fit together like pieces to a puzzle. The shifts and movements of these plates shape our landscape including the spectacular mountain ranges, valleys, and coastlines of our national parks. The theory of plate tectonics was revolutionary in helping us understand how these landscapes formed in the past and how they continue to change during our lifetimes.

The story of plate tectonics starts deep within the Earth. Each layer of the Earth has its own unique properties and chemical composition. The thin outer layer, the one we live on, is broken into several plates that move relative to one another. Plate boundary interactions result in earthquakes and volcanoes, and the formation of mountain ranges, continents, and ocean basins.

The dramatic topography in the West is due to its youth. Mountains and coastlines are continuously being built and deformed because they are at or near active plate boundaries. Features in the East, such as the Appalachian Mountains and Atlantic Coast, formed at plate boundaries, but that was a long time ago. Now, the nearest plate boundaries are more than a thousand miles away, and the landscapes are wearing away.
