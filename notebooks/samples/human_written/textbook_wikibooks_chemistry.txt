0 volume. Anything that has mass must be 3-dimensional, which is why, however small atoms (the stuff that makes up matter) are, they are 3-dimensional.

Mass is a measure of an object's inertia. It is proportional to weight: the more mass an object has, the more weight it has. However, mass is not the same as weight. Weight is a force created by the action of gravity on a substance while mass is a measure of an object's resistance to change in motion. For example, your weight on the moon would be one-sixth your weight on the earth, as the moons gravitational field is one-sixth that of earth's. Mass used to measured by comparing the substance of interest to a standard kilogram called the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK). The IPK is a metal cylinder for which the height and diameter both equal 39.17 millimeters and is made of an alloy of 90% platinum and 10% iridium. Thus, the standard kilogram is defined and all other masses are a comparison to this kilogram. When atom masses are measured in a mass spectrometer, a different internal standard is used. Your take home lesson with regard to mass is that mass is a relative term judged by a comparison. Mass is now defined by a Watt or Kibble balance by measuring the Planck constant. The goal of measuring mass with the Planck constant is to measure mass electronically. The reason for this is that it is a lot easier to make an electronic measurements with electronics and electricity than to weigh something big or small, so researchers have been working on accurately redefining the kilogram to a quantum standard that implements the Watt/Kibble balance for the Planck constant. This change took effect in 20 May 2019 after a historic vote among the members of the CGPM at Versailles in France to redefine the kilogram, ampere, mole, and kelvin. The redefinition of the kilogram was contingent upon continued improvement of this new method of determining mass. National metrology labs such as NIST collaborated to make the redefinition of the kilogram possible.
